# Every day is an oportunity to learn

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

Eslint is designed to be flexible and configurable for each user or each particular workspace. "semi": "error" is one of three forms of requirement, or enforcement level, that enforce the use of semicolon in our code. Other levels of enforcing are "semi": "warn" and "semi": "off" These last two are less grained compare to "semi": "error".
